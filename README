    =========

    Very simple distributed background job executor based on Redis and the Redisson library.


    Defining and running jobs:

    // define the job
    class MyJob extends Job
    {
        @Override
        public void run()
        {
            // do something here
        }
    }

    // create a new task manager and enqueue the job
    TaskManager taskManager = new TaskManager("localhost", 6379);
    taskManager.enqueue(new MyJob());


    Start the worker (you can scale out to as many workers as you want):

    $ java -jar \
        -Dredis_host=localhost \
        -Dredis_port=6379 \
        -Dinterval=1000 \
        -Dthreads=50 \
        elementar.jar
